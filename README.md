Rearranged the original Pete Thinkful site.
Mostly using the flex method.
Most items are now displaying in a horizontal row.
While pragraphs are aligned vertically some of the items.
Links shouldn't work but should react on the hovering pointer still.
I was able to mostly replicate what was asked but feel that I did not due so was was intended.
